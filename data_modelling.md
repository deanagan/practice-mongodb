Data modelling is a way to organize fields in a document to support application performance and querying capabilities.


- Data Modelling Rule:

``` Data is stored in the way it is used. ```

- More Notes

``` Data that is used together should be stored together. ```

``` Evolving application implies an evolving data model. ```
